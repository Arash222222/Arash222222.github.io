<h1>The Title</h1>
<p> <em>This is a<strong> paragraph</strong></em></p>
<p>Suppose we were writing about a concert and wanted to switch the scene from the crowd to backstage then an HR tag might be useful.</p>

<p>If we are writing about a new medicine, and began by describing a patient's story, and wanted to switch to describing how scientists created the medicine, then an HR tag might be helpful.</p>

<hr>

<p>Think of it not as a way to draw a line, but as a way to designate a change of theme. Don't think about its appearance, think about its meaning, about its semantics.</p>
